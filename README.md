 From humble beginnings, I learn to code from scratch. The online courses helped me develop my understanding of how it works and implement the syntax while doing projects. Throughout the learning process, it was intimidating at first but eventually caught up with the learning structure. I created several projects which I think were the most exciting and interactive challenges.
