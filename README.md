# Front-end Web Developer Portfolio
### by Rio Cantre

From humble beginnings, I learn to code from scratch. The online courses helped me develop my understanding of how it works and implement the syntax while doing projects. Throughout the learning process, it was intimidating at first but eventually caught up with the learning structure. I created several projects which I think were the most exciting and interactive challenges.

    It is a project challenge with a given design, and as a developer, I need to code it as close as the design. To build a specific calculator for tips and count the discounts with the given amount and number of people and used HTML, CSS, SaSS, and JavasScript through the whole process.
